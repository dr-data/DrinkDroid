Each time a shot is poured, the DrinkDroid adjusts for the displaced liquid, and recalculates the time the valve needs to be open to pour the same amount. These calculations are specific to the bottle sizes which were used.\r\n[Images](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r0x2qdlkocvbi4m/AACNt8Uqhrj-ajRMnHDmouuNa?dl=0)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
